Congratulations to everyone who ran RACE-23! 👏

Congratulations on being invited here to show availability/interest to participate in Veridise ZK Security Workshop from Oct 30th-Nov 3rd! 👏

You are one of the Top participants as determined by your performance in RACE-23. 🏅

Expectation: This is a 1-week Workshop which requires at least ~20 hours/week for best outcome. Given the duration and high time/effort expectations, please realistically evaluate your availability/interest carefully before deciding to participate. Dropping out midway or being unable to dedicate the expected time will be unfair to this initiative and more so to the other participants on the Top list who may be denied this opportunity. 🙏
